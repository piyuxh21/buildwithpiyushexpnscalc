## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).
3. Make sure your images (e.g., `assets/wheat-field.jpg`) are in the correct folder.

## How to Add a New Category
1. Open `script.js`.
2. At the top, find the `categories` array:
   ```js
   const categories = [
       { name: 'Seeds', color: '#23511e', legend: 'bg-green-900', icon: 'üå±' },
       { name: 'Fertilizer', color: '#e6d7b0', legend: 'bg-[#e6d7b0]', icon: 'üß™' },
       { name: 'Other', color: '#d6b95c', legend: 'bg-[#d6b95c]', icon: 'üîî' }
       // Add more categories here as needed!
   ];
   ```
3. Add a new object for your category. Example:
   ```js
   { name: 'Pesticides', color: '#4b5563', legend: 'bg-gray-600', icon: 'üß¥' }
   ```
4. Save the file and refresh your browser. The new category will appear everywhere automatically.
